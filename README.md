# TCBlobDownload
This little library uses **NSOperations** to download big files using **NSURLConnection** in background threads.

I've implemented **TCBlobDownload** which extends NSOperation and use **TCBlobDownloadManager** to execute it. You can set a delegate or use blocks (your choice) for each download to update your views etcâ€¦

I've tested it with files from ~150MB to ~700MB, mostly videos.

Requires **iOS 5.0 or greater**.

It currently only supports ARC but I hope to make a non-ARC implementation soon.

## Features
1. Download files in background threads.
2. Pause and resume later a download.
3. Set maximum number of concurrent downloads.
4. Blocks || delegate
5. Custom download path and auto path creation.
6. [download cancelDownloadAndRemoveFile:BOOL]

Dependencies and more...

### Methods
**TCBlobDownloadManager**
```objective-c
- (void)startDownloadWithURL:(NSString *)urlString
             downloadPath:(NSString *)customPathOrNil
              andDelegate:(id<TCBlobDownloadDelegate>)delegateOrNil;

- (void)startDownloadWithURL:(NSString *)urlString
             downloadPath:(NSString *)customPathOrNil
            progressBlock:(void (^)(float receivedLength, float totalLength))progressBlock
               errorBlock:(void (^)(NSError *error))errorBlock
          completionBlock:(void (^)())completionBlock;

- (void)startDownload:(TCBlobDownload *)blobDownload;

- (void)setDefaultDownloadDirectory:(NSString *)pathToDL;

- (void)setMaxConcurrentDownloads:(NSInteger)max;

- (NSUInteger)downloadCount;

- (void)cancelAllDownloadsAndRemoveFiles:(BOOL)remove;
```

**TCBlobDownload**
```objective-c
- (id)initWithUrlString:(NSString *)urlString
           downloadPath:(NSString *)pathToDL // cannot be nil
            andDelegate:(id<TCBlobDownloadDelegate>)delegateOrNil;

- (id)initWithUrlString:(NSString *)urlString // cannot be nil
          downloadPath:(NSString *)pathToDL
         progressBlock:(void (^)(float receivedLength, float totalLength))progressBlock
            errorBlock:(void (^)(NSError *error))errorBlock
       completionBlock:(void (^)())completionBlock;

- (void)cancelDownloadAndRemoveFile:(BOOL)remove;
```

## Usage
### Blocks
Blocks are cool.

```objective-c
#import "TCBlobDownloadManager.h"

TCBlobDownloadManager *sharedManager = [TCBlobDownloadManager sharedDownloadManager];

[sharedManager startDownloadWithURL:@"http://give.me/bigfile.avi"
                    downloadPath:nil
                   progressBlock:^(float receivedLength, float totalLength){
                   // wow moving progress bar!
                 }
                      errorBlock:^(NSError *error){
                   // this not cool
                 }
                 completionBlock:^{
                   // this is cool
                 }];
```

This way, your download will immediately start. It will be downloaded in the default download directory (`tmp/` if not set) because customPath is `nil`.

Note that:

```objective-c
NSString *customPath = [NSTemporaryDirectory() stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"My/Custom/Path/"];
[sharedManager addDownloadWithURL:@"http://give.me/bigfile.avi"
                  customPathOrNil:customPath // important
                      andDelegate:nil];
```
 
Will **create** the given path if needed and download the file in the `Path/` directory. **Remember that you should follow the [iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/)**.

### Delegate
You can either set a delegate which can implement those optional methods if delegates have your preference over blocks:

```objective-c
- (void)download:(TCBlobDownload *)blobDownload didReceiveData:(uint64_t)received onTotal:(uint64_t)total
{
  // wow moving progress bar! (bis)
}

- (void)downloadDidFinishWithDownload:(TCBlobDownload *)blobDownload
{
  // this is cool
}

- (void)download:(TCBlobDownload *)blobDownload didStopWithError:(NSError *)error
{
  // this is not cool
}
```

### Other things you should know
**Cool thing 1:** If a download has been stopped and the local file has not been deleted, when you will restart the download to the same local path, the download will start where it has stopped using the HTTP `Range=bytes` header.

**Cool thing 2:** You can also set dependencies in your downloads. See [NSOperation Class Reference](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperation_class/Reference/Reference.html) and the `addDependency:` method in particular.

## Roadmap
If you have any idea, please suggest it! :)

- Encapsulate dependencies
