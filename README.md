# BlobDownloadManager

This little library uses `NSOperationQueue` to download big files using `NSURLConnection`.

I've created `BlobDownloader` which extends `NSOperation` and use `BlobDownloadManager` to execute it. You can set a delegate for each `BlobDownloader` to update your views etcâ€¦

However, BlobDL does not provide a way to store executing downloads, and it's up to you to choose how to store them, and how you retrieve them in their delegate. Better explanation in usage section.

## Features
- Download files in background threads.
- Pause and resume later a download.
- Set maximum number of concurrent downloads.
- Keep trace of your downloads using delegates and update your UI.
- [BlobDownloader endDownloadAndRemoveFile:BOOL]

Files are currently downloaded in the `Documents/` app directory.

## Usage
1. Wild download. (No delegate)

```objective-c
#import "BlobDownloadManager.h"

BlobDownloadManager *sharedManager = [BlobDownloadManager sharedDownloadManager];

[sharedManager addDownloadWithURL:@"http://give.me/bigfile.avi"
                      andDelegate:nil];
```

This way, you your download will start and you'll see the progress in console.

2. If you want to update your UI, you can set a delegate which can implement those optional methods:

```objective-c
- (void)downloader:(BlobDownloader *)blobDownloader
  didReceiveData:(uint64_t)received
         onTotal:(uint64_t)total;

- (void)downloadDidFinishWithDownloader:(BlobDownloader *)blobDownloader;

- (void)downloader:(BlobDownloader *)blobDownloader didStopWithError:(NSError *)error;
```

And the usage becomes:

```objective-c
BlobDownloader *blobDL = [sharedManager addDownloadWithURL:@"http://give.me/bigfile.avi"
                      andDelegate:delegate];
```

Then, if your add multiple downloads to the Manager, you must 
find a way to store the created `BlobDownloader`s. **For example, to update `UIProgressView`s in `UITableViewCell`s, I used a `NSMutableDictionnary` using the cell's `indexPath` as key.** I may update the lib example later, and it would come with a screenshot and that would be nice.

3. Store your `BlobDownloader`s allows you to do:

```objective-c
BlobDownloader *blobDL = [sharedManager addDownloadWithURL:@"http://give.me/bigfile.avi"
                      andDelegate:delegate];

[BlobDownloader endDownloadAndRemoveFile:YES]
```

And to access to its file name and URL address. Blah blah blah.

You can also set dependencies in your downloads. See [NSOperation Class Reference](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSOperation_class/Reference/Reference.html) and the `addDependency:` method in particular.

## Roadmap
It would be great to handle the storage thing and let your mind free of that, but I did not find a way yet. If you have any idea, please suggest it! :)

- Solve the storage thing
- Choose the local download path
- Encapsulate dependencies
